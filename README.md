This is a private hackathon open to UmojaHack South Africa participants. If you are a university student in South Africa and would like to participate, contact Zindi Community Coordinator Paul Kennedy.

Ride-hailing apps like Uber and Yassir rely on real-time data and machine learning algorithms to automate their services. Accurately predicting the estimated time of arrival (ETA) for Yassir trips will make Yassirâ€™s services more reliable and attractive; this will have a direct and indirect impact on both customers and business partners. The solution would help the company save money and allocate more resources to other parts of the business.

The objective of this hackathon is to predict the estimated time of arrival at the dropoff point for a single Yassir journey.
